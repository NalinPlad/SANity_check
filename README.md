> Where can I use this tool?

For security reasons, I'm not running a public SANity server atm. If you feel so compelled, you can set up a public server for people to use.

To start a SANity server, navigate to the `ROCKET` directory and run `cargo run --release`. 
This will start a server on port 8000. 
Changing ports at runtime is not currently supported, change the hardcoded value in the source code.

SANity has a standalone frontend project, seperate from the server. 
Navigate to `WWW` and run the `dev` alias in the package.json. For example, `yarn run dev`, or `npm run dev`. 
Make sure to install the dependancies first; `yarn install`, `npm install`.
